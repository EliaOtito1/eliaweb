      Orpheus with his lute made trees, <em>And the mountain tops that freeze</em>, Bow themselves, when he did sing: To his music plants and flowers Ever sprung; as sun and showers <strong>There had made a lasting spring. Everything that heard him play, Even the billows of the sea</strong>, Hung their heads, and then lay by. In sweet music is such art, Killing care and grief of heart Fall asleep, or hearing, die. When Orpheus sweetly did complayne Upon his lute with heavy strayne How his Euridice was slayne, The trees to heare Obtayn'd an eare, And after left it off againe. At every stroake and every stay The boughs kept time, and nodding lay, And listened bending all one way: The aspen tree As well as hee Began to shake and learn'd to play.

         The climate is like a bathtub that’s slowly filling up with water. Even if we slow the flow of water to a trickle, the tub will eventually fill up and water will come spilling out onto the floor. That’s the disaster we have to prevent. Setting a goal to only reduce our emissions—but not eliminate them—won’t do it.”― Bill Gates, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.

          To avoid the trap of Europe fragmenting on the economy, security, and identity, we have to return to the original promises of the European project: peace, prosperity and freedom. We should have a real, adult, democratic debate about the Europe we want.
